Travelers optimize for destinations visited, but the real constraint is transition cost. Airports, check-ins, transfers, and recovery time compound quickly.</p><p>A better model is to design around anchors: one high-intensity day followed by one medium day, with transfer windows buffered by low-risk activities. This preserves energy and improves memory quality for the whole trip.</p><p>TravelTime uses this pattern in all route templates. We score each day for physical load, transition complexity, and margin for delays. The result is a plan that feels full, not chaotic.</p></CardContent></Card>;}
